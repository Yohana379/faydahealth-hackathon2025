# Problem Synopsis
# Problem Statement:- 
In Ethiopia, patients often face serious challenges due to the lack of a centralized and reliable system for tracking medical history. When people visit different clinics or hospitals, their past records are 
usually missing, stored on paper, or lost altogether. This makes it hard for doctors to give quick and accurate care, often leading to repeated tests, misdiagnoses, or delayed treatments. 
For patients, this not only costs time and money but can also risk their health.

# Expected Outcome:- 
We aim to reduce the confusion and delays that happen when patients go from one clinic to another without their history. With this system, doctors will make faster and better decisions, patients will avoid 
repeating tests, and hospitals will save time and resources. Most importantly, people will receive more consistent and effective care across the country.

# Planned Solution:- 
We’re building a mobile app that connects patient medical records to their Fayda ID, creating a digital health profile that moves with the person—no matter where they go. Health professionals will be able 
to quickly pull up a patient’s history using their Fayda number, making it easier to understand past treatments, medications, and diagnoses. The app will be simple, secure, and usable even in low-resource settings.

# Role of Fayda in HealthTech:-
Fayda, Ethiopia’s National Digital ID, gives every citizen a unique, verified identity. In healthcare, this can solve one of the biggest challenges: connecting a patient to their medical history across different
hospitals and clinics. Right now, patients are often treated as “new” at every facility because their records are not linked or easily accessible. This leads to repeated tests, misdiagnoses, and unnecessary delays. 
But with Fayda, we can change that. Our plan is to link every patient's medical history to their Fayda ID, so that whenever they visit a clinic or hospital, healthcare providers can quickly and securely access 
their past records using that ID. This means better diagnosis, safer treatment, and faster care.
The app will allow healthcare workers to:
1. Look up patients by scanning or entering their Fayda number.
2. View previous visits, prescriptions, test results, and treatments.
3. Add new medical data that’s instantly tied to the correct patient.

# Tech Stack
A detailed breakdown of the tools, technologies, and frameworks are going to be used for this project:-
# Frontend
1. Flutter - Used to develop a responsive, cross-platform mobile app.
2. Dart - For implementing the app's logic and UI.
3. Firebase UI kit - For modern, accessible, and clean UI components.
# Backend
1. Firebase Firestore - A real-time NoSQL database to store patient profiles and medical history securely.
2. Firebase Authentication - Handles user login and simulates Fayda ID verification securely.
3. Node js - (Optional) For implementing additional backend logic.
# Fayda ID Integration Simulated
1. Simulated API layer to represent National ID (Fayda) verification and linking.
2. Integration of Barcode scanner to read patient IDs and link to medical records.
# Dev Tools and Version control
1. Git - Version control for team collaboration and tracking progress.
2. GitHub - Repository hosting, issues management, and reviewer collaboration.
# Design and Testing 
1. Figma - Used for prototyping UI and designing wireframes.
2. Visual Studio Code / Android Studio - Development environments for Flutter and mobile app deployment.
3. Postman - For testing API endpoints (simulated Fayda API).
